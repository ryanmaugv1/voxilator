# Voxilator

Addon which enables hassle-free voxel art workflow for game development using Blender.

The workflow we plan to augment would look something like this:

`Voxel Editor ---(export)---> Blender ---(export)---> Game Engine`

- **Voxel Editor**, used for developing your voxel models.
- **Blender**, used to rig, skin and animate your voxel modelsn and more.
- **Game Engine**, used to bring your Blender augmented voxel models to life (with no hassle).

## Features

- Mesh Optimisation
  - **Face filtering**, removes selected or unselected faces from selected meshes.
  - **Face scaling**, scales/merges faces on single mesh by scale factor to reduce mesh complexity.
